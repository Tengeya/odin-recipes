        <h2><b>Description</b></h2>
        <p>Italian wedding soup is a hearty Italian soup consisting of noodles, vegetables, meatballs, and broth. It was originally a "peasant dish," meaning it's made from inexpensive ingredients that anyone could find.</p>
        <P>Even though it's called "wedding soup," this soup has nothing to do with weddings. The name comes from the Italian phrase "minestra maritata," which actually means married soup. But it's not the marriage we think of — it's actually referring to the marriage of the ingredients and the flavor it produces.</P>
        <h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound extra-lean ground beef</li>
            <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>5 ¾ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 cups thinly sliced escarole</li>
            <li>1 cup uncooked orzo pasta</li>
            <li>⅓ cup finely chopped carrot</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Steps</b></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine ground beef, egg, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and onion powder in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Shape beef mixture into 3/4-inch balls and place on a parchment-lined tray.</li>
            <li>Heat broth in a large pot over medium-high heat until boiling. Stir in escarole, orzo, carrot, and meatballs and return to boil. Reduce heat to medium and cook at slow boil, stirring frequently to prevent sticking, until pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
